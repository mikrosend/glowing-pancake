* PyPDF2

In addition, the following third-party tools are required:
* Inkscape >= v.1.0.1
* Ghostscript >= v.9.26

To get the Ghostscript reference correct, the path to where the file `gswin64c.exe` is located should be added to the environmental variable `system`. In a standard gs9.26 installation, the file is located in `C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.26.bin\`.
